# Cool-Text-Editor 

## Description

This project is a text editor that runs in the browser as a Progressive Web Application (PWA). It allows users to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection and reliably retrieve them for later use. The motivation behind this project was to build a practical, offline-capable application using modern web technologies. Through this project, I learned how to implement a PWA, use IndexedDB for client-side storage, and deploy a full-stack application.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/just-another-text-editor.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Install dependencies for the server:

## Usage

    npm run server
